  <h2>Problem:</h2><br>
  <p>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, which causes lesions on the retina that affect vision. If it is not detected early, it can lead to blindness. Unfortunately, DR is not a reversible process, and treatment only sustains vision. DR early detection and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of vision loss. The manual diagnosis process of DR retina fundus images by ophthalmologists is time, effort and cost-consuming and prone to misdiagnosis unlike computer-aided diagnosis systems. 


    Transfer learning has become one of the most common techniques that has achieved better performance in many areas, especially in medical image analysis and classification. We used Transfer Learning techniques like Inception V3,Resnet50,Xception V3 that are more widely used as a transfer learning method in medical image analysis and they are highly effective.
    
    </p>
    <h2>Solution: </h2>
    <p>Here we present a deep learning system that identifies referable diabetic retinopathy comparably or better than presented in the previous studies, although we use only a small fraction of images (less than 1/4th) in training but are aided with higher image resolutions.Over the last few years, research into the 
      application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the 
      diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) has 
      exploded.
      CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) are used 
      for image processing tasks since CNNs, were 
      designed to map image data to an output 
      variable.They have proven so effective that they 
      are the go-to method for any type of prediction 
      problem involving image data as an input.
      The Fundus image of the dataset will be trained 
      and tested through the CNN model for better 
      detection.
      Training a whole CNN from scratch is difficult to 
      implement. So, it is common to use a pre-trained 
      model trained on a variety of images in the similar 
      task. So, in order to tackle the above problem, 
      we use transfer learning techniques like Inception 
      V3,Resnet50,Xception V3 in medical image 
      analysis and they are highly effective.</p>
